I am a graduate student at the University of Utah, pursuing Masters (MS) in
Computer Science at the [School of Computing][soc-link]. I graduated with a
Bachelor of Technlogy from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering]
[csed-link], National Institute of Technology, Calicut (NITC). My interests
include Operating Systems, Embedded Systems etc.

While Malayalam is my mother tongue, I am well versed in English and Hindi. I
also speak a little Tamil. In addition to soccer (or football outside the US),
I also like going for a walk and explore places (and taking pics along).
