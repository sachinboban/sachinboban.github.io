## Hello! I am Sachin Boban!ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at the University of Utah, pursuing Masters (MS) in
Computer Science at the [School of Computing][soc-link]. I graduated with a
Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from

I also like going for a walk and explore places (and taking [pics][insta-link]
