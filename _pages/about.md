I am a graduate student at the University of Utah, pursuing Masters (MS) in
Computer Science at the [School of Computing][soc-link]. I graduated with a

of Technology, Calicut (NITC). My interests include Operating Systems, Embedded
Systems etc. Very recently I have started taking interest in Distributed Systems,
Database Systems, JavaScript and [flutter][flutter-link].

While Malayalam is my mother tongue, I am well versed in English and Hindi. I
also speak a little Tamil. In addition to soccer (or football outside the US),
I also like going for a walk and explore places (and taking [pics][insta-link]
along).
